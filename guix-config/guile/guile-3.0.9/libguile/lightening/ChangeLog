Starting from October 30, 2018, the Lightening project no longer stores
change logs in `ChangeLog' files.  Instead, changes are detailed in the
version control system's logs.  They can be seen by downloading a copy
of the Git repository:

  $ git clone https://gitlab.com/wingo/lightening
  $ git log

Alternatively, they can be seen on the web, using the Gitweb interface
at:

  https://gitlab.com/wingo/lightening

Change logs from upstream GNU Lightning are still available in
ChangeLog.lightning.

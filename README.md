## END OF THE INTRODUCTION

## The Start of Your journey

ok you will encounter some challenges making this configuration. but i will assure you this will be worth it. because after learning this package manager and a little of guile scheme you will never ever EVER have to learn another package manager again.

DO NOT JUMP STRAIGHT INTO THIS and try to do everything at once, take your time reading the documentation i wrote,testing,trying out stuff.

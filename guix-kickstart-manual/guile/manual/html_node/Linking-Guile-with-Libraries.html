<h3 class="section" id="Linking-Guile-with-Libraries-1">5.3 Linking Guile with Libraries</h3>

<p>The previous section has briefly explained how to write programs that
make use of an embedded Guile interpreter.  But sometimes, all you
want to do is make new primitive procedures and data types available
to the Scheme programmer.  Writing a new version of <code class="code">guile</code> is
inconvenient in this case and it would in fact make the life of the
users of your new features needlessly hard.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose that there is a program <code class="code">guile-db</code> that is a
version of Guile with additional features for accessing a database.
People who want to write Scheme programs that use these features would
have to use <code class="code">guile-db</code> instead of the usual <code class="code">guile</code> program.
Now suppose that there is also a program <code class="code">guile-gtk</code> that extends
Guile with access to the popular Gtk+ toolkit for graphical user
interfaces.  People who want to write GUIs in Scheme would have to use
<code class="code">guile-gtk</code>.  Now, what happens when you want to write a Scheme
application that uses a GUI to let the user access a database?  You
would have to write a <em class="emph">third</em> program that incorporates both the
database stuff and the GUI stuff.  This might not be easy (because
<code class="code">guile-gtk</code> might be a quite obscure program, say) and taking this
example further makes it easy to see that this approach can not work in
practice.
</p>
<p>It would have been much better if both the database features and the GUI
feature had been provided as libraries that can just be linked with
<code class="code">guile</code>.  Guile makes it easy to do just this, and we encourage you
to make your extensions to Guile available as libraries whenever
possible.
</p>
<p>You write the new primitive procedures and data types in the normal
fashion, and link them into a shared library instead of into a
stand-alone program.  The shared library can then be loaded dynamically
by Guile.

<h4 class="subsubsection" id="Trap-Interface-1">6.26.4.2 Trap Interface</h4>

<p>The capabilities provided by hooks are great, but hooks alone rarely
correspond to what users want to do.
</p>
<p>For example, if a user wants to break when and if control reaches a
certain source location, how do you do it?  If you install a &ldquo;next&rdquo;
hook, you get unacceptable overhead for the execution of the entire
program. It would be possible to install an &ldquo;apply&rdquo; hook, then if the
procedure encompasses those source locations, install a &ldquo;next&rdquo; hook,
but already you&rsquo;re talking about one concept that might be implemented
by a varying number of lower-level concepts.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best to be clear about things and define one abstraction for all
such conditions: the <em class="dfn">trap</em>.
</p>
<p>Considering the myriad capabilities offered by the hooks though, there
is only a minimum of functionality shared by all traps. Guile&rsquo;s current
take is to reduce this to the absolute minimum, and have the only
standard interface of a trap be &ldquo;turn yourself on&rdquo; or &ldquo;turn yourself
off&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>This interface sounds a bit strange, but it is useful to procedurally
compose higher-level traps from lower-level building blocks. For
example, Guile defines a trap that calls one handler when control enters
a procedure, and another when control leaves the procedure. Given that
trap, one can define a trap that adds to the next-hook only when within
a given procedure. Building further, one can define a trap that fires
when control reaches particular instructions within a procedure.
</p>
<p>Or of course you can stop at any of these intermediate levels. For
example, one might only be interested in calls to a given procedure. But
the point is that a simple enable/disable interface is all the
commonality that exists between the various kinds of traps, and
furthermore that such an interface serves to allow &ldquo;higher-level&rdquo;
traps to be composed from more primitive ones.
</p>
<p>Specifically, a trap, in Guile, is a procedure. When a trap is created,
by convention the trap is enabled; therefore, the procedure that is the
trap will, when called, disable the trap, and return a procedure that
will enable the trap, and so on.
</p>
<p>Trap procedures take one optional argument: the current frame. (A trap
may want to add to different sets of hooks depending on the frame that
is current at enable-time.)
</p>
<p>If this all sounds very complicated, it&rsquo;s because it is. Some of it is
essential, but probably most of it is not. The advantage of using this
minimal interface is that composability is more lexically apparent than
when, for example, using a stateful interface based on GOOPS. But
perhaps this reflects the cognitive limitations of the programmer who
made the current interface more than anything else.

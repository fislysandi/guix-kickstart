<h4 class="subsection" id="Why-Scheme-is-More-Hackable-Than-C">5.7.2 Why Scheme is More Hackable Than C</h4>

<p>Underlying Guile&rsquo;s value proposition is the assumption that programming
in a high level language, specifically Guile&rsquo;s implementation of Scheme,
is necessarily better in some way than programming in C.  What do we
mean by this claim, and how can we be so sure?
</p>
<p>One class of advantages applies not only to Scheme, but more generally
to any interpretable, high level, scripting language, such as Emacs
Lisp, Python, Ruby, or TeX&rsquo;s macro language.  Common features of all
such languages, when compared to C, are that:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>They lend themselves to rapid and experimental development cycles,
owing usually to a combination of their interpretability and the
integrated development environment in which they are used.

</li><li>They free developers from some of the low level bookkeeping tasks
associated with C programming, notably memory management.

</li><li>They provide high level features such as container objects and exception
handling that make common programming tasks easier.
</li></ul>

<p>In the case of Scheme, particular features that make programming easier
&mdash; and more fun! &mdash; are its powerful mechanisms for abstracting parts
of programs (closures &mdash; see <a class="pxref" href="About-Closure.html">The Concept of Closure</a>) and for iteration
(see <a class="pxref" href="while-do.html">Iteration mechanisms</a>).
</p>
<p>The evidence in support of this argument is empirical: the huge amount
of code that has been written in extension languages for applications
that support this mechanism.  Most notable are extensions written in
Emacs Lisp for GNU Emacs, in TeX&rsquo;s macro language for TeX, and in
Script-Fu for the Gimp, but there is increasingly now a significant code
eco-system for Guile-based applications as well, such as Lilypond and
GnuCash.  It is close to inconceivable that similar amounts of
functionality could have been added to these applications just by
writing new code in their base implementation languages.

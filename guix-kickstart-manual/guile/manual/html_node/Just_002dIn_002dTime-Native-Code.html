<p>The final piece of Guile&rsquo;s virtual machine is a just-in-time (JIT)
compiler from bytecode instructions to native code.  It is faster to run
a function when its bytecode instructions are compiled to native code,
compared to having the VM interpret the instructions.
</p>
<p>The JIT compiler runs automatically, triggered by counters associated
with each function.  The counter increments when functions are called
and during each loop iteration.  Once a function&rsquo;s counter passes a
certain value, the function gets JIT-compiled.  See <a class="xref" href="Instrumentation-Instructions.html">Instrumentation Instructions</a>, for full details.
</p>
<p>Guile&rsquo;s JIT compiler is what is known as a <em class="dfn">template JIT</em>.  This
kind of JIT is very simple: for each instruction in a function, the JIT
compiler will emit a generic sequence of machine code corresponding to
the instruction kind, specializing that generic template to reference
the specific operands of the instruction being compiled.
</p>
<p>The strength of a template JIT is principally that it is very fast at
emitting code.  It doesn&rsquo;t need to do any time-consuming analysis on the
bytecode that it is compiling to do its job.
</p>
<p>A template JIT is also very predictable: the native code emitted by a
template JIT has the same performance characteristics of the
corresponding bytecode, only that it runs faster.  In theory you could
even generate the template-JIT machine code ahead of time, as it doesn&rsquo;t
depend on any value seen at run-time.
</p>
<p>This predictability makes it possible to reason about the performance of
a system in terms of bytecode, knowing that the conclusions apply to
native code emitted by a template JIT.
</p>
<p>Because the machine code corresponding to an instruction always performs
the same tasks that the interpreter would do for that instruction,
bytecode and a template JIT also allows Guile programmers to debug their
programs in terms of the bytecode model.  When a Guile programmer sets a
breakpoint, Guile will disable the JIT for the thread being debugged,
falling back to the interpreter (which has the corresponding code to run
the hooks).  See <a class="xref" href="VM-Hooks.html">VM Hooks</a>.
</p>
<p>To emit native code, Guile uses a forked version of GNU Lightning.  This
&quot;Lightening&quot; effort, spun out as a separate project, aims to build on
the back-end support from GNU Lightning, but adapting the API and
behavior of the library to match Guile&rsquo;s needs.  This code is included
in the Guile source distribution.  For more information, see
<a class="url" href="https://gitlab.com/wingo/lightening">https://gitlab.com/wingo/lightening</a>.  As of mid-2019, Lightening
supports code generation for the x86-64, ia32, ARMv7, and AArch64
architectures.
</p>
<p>The weaknesses of a template JIT are two-fold.  Firstly, as a simple
back-end that has to run fast, a template JIT doesn&rsquo;t have time to do
analysis that could help it generate better code, notably global
register allocation and instruction selection.
</p>
<p>However this is a minor weakness compared to the inability to perform
significant, speculative program transformations.  For example, Guile
could see that in an expression <code class="code">(f x)</code>, that in practice <var class="var">f</var>
always refers to the same function.  An advanced JIT compiler would
speculatively inline <var class="var">f</var> into the call-site, along with a dynamic
check to make sure that the assertion still held.  But as a template JIT
doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to values only known at run-time, it can&rsquo;t make
this transformation.
</p>
<p>This limitation is mitigated in part by Guile&rsquo;s robust ahead-of-time
compiler which can already perform significant optimizations when it can
prove they will always be valid, and its low-level bytecode which is
able to represent the effect of those optimizations (e.g. elided
type-checks).  See <a class="xref" href="Compiling-to-the-Virtual-Machine.html">Compiling to the Virtual Machine</a>, for more on
Guile&rsquo;s compiler.
</p>
<p>An ahead-of-time Scheme-to-bytecode strategy, complemented by a template
JIT, also particularly suits the somewhat static nature of Scheme.
Scheme programmers often write code in a way that makes the identity of
free variable references lexically apparent.  For example, the <code class="code">(f
x)</code> expression could appear within a <code class="code">(let ((f (lambda (x) (1+
x)))) ...)</code> expression, or we could see that <code class="code">f</code> was imported from
a particular module where we know its binding.  Ahead-of-time
compilation techniques can work well for a language like Scheme where
there is little polymorphism and much first-order programming.  They do
not work so well for a language like JavaScript, which is highly mutable
at run-time and difficult to analyze due to method calls (which are
effectively higher-order calls).
</p>
<p>All that said, a template JIT works well for Guile at this point.  It&rsquo;s
only a few thousand lines of maintainable code, it speeds up Scheme
programs, and it keeps the bulk of the Guile Scheme implementation
written in Scheme itself.  The next step is probably to add
ahead-of-time native code emission to the back-end of the compiler
written in Scheme, to take advantage of the opportunity to do global
register allocation and instruction selection.  Once this is working, it
can allow Guile to experiment with speculative optimizations in Scheme
as well.  See <a class="xref" href="Extending-the-Compiler.html">Extending the Compiler</a>, for more on future directions.
</p>
<p>Finally, note that there are a few environment variables that can be
tweaked to make JIT compilation happen sooner, later, or never.
See <a class="xref" href="Environment-Variables.html">Environment Variables</a>, for more.

<h4 class="subsection" id="Metaobjects-and-the-Metaobject-Protocol-1">8.11.1 Metaobjects and the Metaobject Protocol</h4>

<p>The building blocks of GOOPS are classes, slot definitions, instances,
generic functions and methods.  A class is a grouping of inheritance
relations and slot definitions.  An instance is an object with slots
that are allocated following the rules implied by its class&rsquo;s
superclasses and slot definitions.  A generic function is a collection
of methods and rules for determining which of those methods to apply
when the generic function is invoked.  A method is a procedure and a set
of specializers that specify the type of arguments to which the
procedure is applicable.
</p>
<p>Of these entities, GOOPS represents classes, generic functions and
methods as &ldquo;metaobjects&rdquo;.  In other words, the values in a GOOPS
program that describe classes, generic functions and methods, are
themselves instances (or &ldquo;objects&rdquo;) of special GOOPS classes that
encapsulate the behaviour, respectively, of classes, generic functions,
and methods.
</p>
<p>(The other two entities are slot definitions and instances.  Slot
definitions are not strictly instances, but every slot definition is
associated with a GOOPS class that specifies the behaviour of the slot
as regards accessibility and protection from garbage collection.
Instances are of course objects in the usual sense, and there is no
benefit from thinking of them as metaobjects.)
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;metaobject protocol&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MOP&rdquo;) is the specification of the
generic functions which determine the behaviour of these metaobjects and
the circumstances in which these generic functions are invoked.
</p>
<p>For a concrete example of what this means, consider how GOOPS calculates
the set of slots for a class that is being defined using
<code class="code">define-class</code>.  The desired set of slots is the union of the new
class&rsquo;s direct slots and the slots of all its superclasses.  But
<code class="code">define-class</code> itself does not perform this calculation.  Instead,
there is a method of the <code class="code">initialize</code> generic function that is
specialized for instances of type <code class="code">&lt;class&gt;</code>, and it is this method
that performs the slot calculation.
</p>
<p><code class="code">initialize</code> is a generic function which GOOPS calls whenever a new
instance is created, immediately after allocating memory for a new
instance, in order to initialize the new instance&rsquo;s slots.  The sequence
of steps is as follows.
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li><code class="code">define-class</code> uses <code class="code">make</code> to make a new instance of the
<code class="code">&lt;class&gt;</code> class, passing as initialization arguments the
superclasses, slot definitions and class options that were specified in
the <code class="code">define-class</code> form.

</li><li><code class="code">make</code> allocates memory for the new instance, and invokes the
<code class="code">initialize</code> generic function to initialize the new instance&rsquo;s
slots.

</li><li>The <code class="code">initialize</code> generic function applies the method that is
specialized for instances of type <code class="code">&lt;class&gt;</code>, and this method
performs the slot calculation.
</li></ul>

<p>In other words, rather than being hardcoded in <code class="code">define-class</code>, the
default behaviour of class definition is encapsulated by generic
function methods that are specialized for the class <code class="code">&lt;class&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>It is possible to create a new class that inherits from <code class="code">&lt;class&gt;</code>,
which is called a &ldquo;metaclass&rdquo;, and to write a new <code class="code">initialize</code>
method that is specialized for instances of the new metaclass.  Then, if
the <code class="code">define-class</code> form includes a <code class="code">#:metaclass</code> class option
whose value is the new metaclass, the class that is defined by the
<code class="code">define-class</code> form will be an instance of the new metaclass rather
than of the default <code class="code">&lt;class&gt;</code>, and will be defined in accordance
with the new <code class="code">initialize</code> method.  Thus the default slot
calculation, as well as any other aspect of the new class&rsquo;s relationship
with its superclasses, can be modified or overridden.
</p>
<p>In a similar way, the behaviour of generic functions can be modified or
overridden by creating a new class that inherits from the standard
generic function class <code class="code">&lt;generic&gt;</code>, writing appropriate methods
that are specialized to the new class, and creating new generic
functions that are instances of the new class.
</p>
<p>The same is true for method metaobjects.  And the same basic mechanism
allows the application class author to write an <code class="code">initialize</code> method
that is specialized to their application class, to initialize instances
of that class.
</p>
<p>Such is the power of the MOP.  Note that <code class="code">initialize</code> is just one
of a large number of generic functions that can be customized to modify
the behaviour of application objects and classes and of GOOPS itself.
Each following section covers a particular area of GOOPS functionality,
and describes the generic functions that are relevant for customization
of that area.

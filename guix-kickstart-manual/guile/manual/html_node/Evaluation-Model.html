<h4 class="subsection" id="Evaluation-and-the-Scheme-Stack">6.26.1 Evaluation and the Scheme Stack</h4>

<p>The idea of the Scheme stack is central to a lot of debugging.  The
Scheme stack is a reified representation of the pending function returns
in an expression&rsquo;s continuation.  As Guile implements function calls
using a stack, this reification takes the form of a number of nested
stack frames, each of which corresponds to the application of a
procedure to a set of arguments.
</p>
<p>A Scheme stack always exists implicitly, and can be summoned into
concrete existence as a first-class Scheme value by the
<code class="code">make-stack</code> call, so that an introspective Scheme program &ndash; such
as a debugger &ndash; can present it in some way and allow the user to query
its details. The first thing to understand, therefore, is how Guile&rsquo;s
function call convention creates the stack.
</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, Guile represents all control flow on a stack. Calling
a function involves pushing an empty frame on the stack, then evaluating
the procedure and its arguments, then fixing up the new frame so that it
points to the old one. Frames on the stack are thus linked together. A
tail call is the same, except it reuses the existing frame instead of
pushing on a new one.
</p>
<p>In this way, the only frames that are on the stack are &ldquo;active&rdquo;
frames, frames which need to do some work before the computation is
complete. On the other hand, a function that has tail-called another
function will not be on the stack, as it has no work left to do.
</p>
<p>Therefore, when an error occurs in a running program, or the program
hits a breakpoint, or in fact at any point that the programmer chooses,
its state at that point can be represented by a <em class="dfn">stack</em> of all the
procedure applications that are logically in progress at that time, each
of which is known as a <em class="dfn">frame</em>.  The programmer can learn more about
the program&rsquo;s state at that point by inspecting the stack and its
frames.

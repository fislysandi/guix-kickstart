<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-transducers-discussion"></a>

<h4 class="subheading" id="The-concept-of-reducers">The concept of reducers</h4>
<p>The central part of transducers are 3-arity reducing procedures.
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>no arguments: Produces the identity of the reducer.

</li><li>(result-so-far): completion. Returns <code class="code">result-so-far</code> either with or
without transforming it first.

</li><li>(result-so-far input) combines <code class="code">result-so-far</code> and <code class="code">input</code> to produce
a new <code class="code">result-so-far</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>In the case of a summing <code class="code">+</code> reducer, the reducer would produce, in
arity order: <code class="code">0</code>, <code class="code">result-so-far</code>, <code class="code">(+ result-so-far
input)</code>. This happens to be exactly what the regular <code class="code">+</code> does.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="The-concept-of-transducers">The concept of transducers</h4>
<p>A transducer is a one-arity procedure that takes a reducer and produces a
reducing function that behaves as follows:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>no arguments: calls reducer with no arguments (producing its identity)

</li><li>(result-so-far): Maybe transform the result-so-far and call reducer with it.

</li><li>(result-so-far input) Maybe do something to input and maybe call the
reducer with result-so-far and the maybe-transformed input.
</li></ul>

<p>A simple example is as following:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(list-transduce (tfilter odd?) + '(1 2 3 4 5)).
</pre></div>

<p>This first returns a transducer filtering all odd
elements, then it runs <code class="code">+</code> without arguments to retrieve its
identity.  It then starts the transduction by passing <code class="code">+</code> to the
transducer returned by <code class="code">(tfilter odd?)</code> which returns a reducing
function.  It works not unlike reduce from SRFI 1, but also checks
whether one of the intermediate transducers returns a &quot;reduced&quot; value
(implemented as a SRFI 9 record), which means the reduction finished
early.
</p>
<p>Because transducers compose and the final reduction is only executed in
the last step, composed transducers will not build any intermediate
result or collections.  Although the normal way of thinking about
application of composed functions is right to left, due to how the
transduction is built it is applied left to right.  <code class="code">(compose
(tfilter odd?) (tmap sqrt))</code> will create a transducer that first filters
out any odd values and then computes the square root of the rest.
</p>

<h4 class="subheading" id="State">State</h4>
<p>Even though transducers appear to be somewhat of a generalisation of
<code class="code">map</code> and friends, this is not really true.  Since transducers don&rsquo;t
know in which context they are being used, some transducers must keep
state where their collection-specific counterparts do not.  The
transducers that keep state do so using hidden mutable state, and as
such all the caveats of mutation, parallelism, and multi-shot
continuations apply.  Each transducer keeping state is clearly described
as doing so in the documentation.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="Naming">Naming</h4>

<p>Reducers exported from the transducers module are named as in their
SRFI-1 counterpart, but prepended with an r.  Transducers also follow
that naming, but are prepended with a t.

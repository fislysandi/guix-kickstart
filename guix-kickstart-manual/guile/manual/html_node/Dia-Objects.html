<h4 class="subsubsection" id="How-to-Represent-Dia-Data-in-Scheme">5.7.1.3 How to Represent Dia Data in Scheme</h4>

<p>For all but the most trivial applications, you will probably want to
allow some representation of your domain objects to exist on the Scheme
level.  This is where foreign objects come in, and with them issues of
lifetime management and garbage collection.
</p>
<p>To get more concrete about this, let&rsquo;s look again at the example we gave
earlier of how application users can use Guile to build higher-level
functions from the primitives that Dia itself provides.
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">(define (change-squares'-fill-pattern new-pattern)
  (for-each-shape current-page
    (lambda (shape)
      (if (square? shape)
          (change-fill-pattern shape new-pattern)))))
</pre></div>

<p>Consider what is stored here in the variable <code class="code">shape</code>.  For each
shape on the current page, the <code class="code">for-each-shape</code> primitive calls
<code class="code">(lambda (shape) &hellip;)</code> with an argument representing that
shape.  Question is: how is that argument represented on the Scheme
level?  The issues are as follows.
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Whatever the representation, it has to be decodable again by the C code
for the <code class="code">square?</code> and <code class="code">change-fill-pattern</code> primitives.  In
other words, a primitive like <code class="code">square?</code> has somehow to be able to
turn the value that it receives back into something that points to the
underlying C structure describing a shape.

</li><li>The representation must also cope with Scheme code holding on to the
value for later use.  What happens if the Scheme code stores
<code class="code">shape</code> in a global variable, but then that shape is deleted (in a
way that the Scheme code is not aware of), and later on some other
Scheme code uses that global variable again in a call to, say,
<code class="code">square?</code>?

</li><li>The lifetime and memory allocation of objects that exist <em class="emph">only</em> in
the Scheme world is managed automatically by Guile&rsquo;s garbage collector
using one simple rule: when there are no remaining references to an
object, the object is considered dead and so its memory is freed.  But
for objects that exist in both C and Scheme, the picture is more
complicated; in the case of Dia, where the <code class="code">shape</code> argument passes
transiently in and out of the Scheme world, it would be quite wrong the
<strong class="strong">delete</strong> the underlying C shape just because the Scheme code has
finished evaluation.  How do we avoid this happening?
</li></ul>

<p>One resolution of these issues is for the Scheme-level representation of
a shape to be a new, Scheme-specific C structure wrapped up as a foreign
object.  The foreign object is what is passed into and out of Scheme
code, and the Scheme-specific C structure inside the foreign object
points to Dia&rsquo;s underlying C structure so that the code for primitives
like <code class="code">square?</code> can get at it.
</p>
<p>To cope with an underlying shape being deleted while Scheme code is
still holding onto a Scheme shape value, the underlying C structure
should have a new field that points to the Scheme-specific foreign
object.  When a shape is deleted, the relevant code chains through to
the Scheme-specific structure and sets its pointer back to the
underlying structure to NULL.  Thus the foreign object value for the
shape continues to exist, but any primitive code that tries to use it
will detect that the underlying shape has been deleted because the
underlying structure pointer is NULL.
</p>
<p>So, to summarize the steps involved in this resolution of the problem
(and assuming that the underlying C structure for a shape is
<code class="code">struct dia_shape</code>):
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Define a new Scheme-specific structure that <em class="emph">points</em> to the
underlying C structure:

<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">struct dia_guile_shape
{
  struct dia_shape * c_shape;   /* NULL =&gt; deleted */
}
</pre></div>

</li><li>Add a field to <code class="code">struct dia_shape</code> that points to its <code class="code">struct
dia_guile_shape</code> if it has one &mdash;

<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">struct dia_shape
{
  &hellip;
  struct dia_guile_shape * guile_shape;
}
</pre></div>

<p>&mdash; so that C code can set <code class="code">guile_shape-&gt;c_shape</code> to NULL when the
underlying shape is deleted.
</p>
</li><li>Wrap <code class="code">struct dia_guile_shape</code> as a foreign object type.

</li><li>Whenever you need to represent a C shape onto the Scheme level, create a
foreign object instance for it, and pass that.

</li><li>In primitive code that receives a shape foreign object instance, check the
<code class="code">c_shape</code> field when decoding it, to find out whether the
underlying C shape is still there.
</li></ul>

<p>As far as memory management is concerned, the foreign object values and
their Scheme-specific structures are under the control of the garbage
collector, whereas the underlying C structures are explicitly managed in
exactly the same way that Dia managed them before we thought of adding
Guile.
</p>
<p>When the garbage collector decides to free a shape foreign object value,
it calls the <em class="dfn">finalizer</em> function that was specified when defining
the shape foreign object type.  To maintain the correctness of the
<code class="code">guile_shape</code> field in the underlying C structure, this function
should chain through to the underlying C structure (if it still exists)
and set its <code class="code">guile_shape</code> field to NULL.

<h4 class="subsection" id="Non_002dBlocking-I_002fO-1">6.12.14 Non-Blocking I/O</h4>

<p>Most ports in Guile are <em class="dfn">blocking</em>: when you try to read a character
from a port, Guile will block on the read until a character is ready, or
end-of-stream is detected.  Likewise whenever Guile goes to write
(possibly buffered) data to an output port, Guile will block until all
the data is written.
</p>
<p>Interacting with ports in blocking mode is very convenient: you can
write straightforward, sequential algorithms whose code flow reflects
the flow of data.  However, blocking I/O has two main limitations.
</p>
<p>The first is that it&rsquo;s easy to get into a situation where code is
waiting on data.  Time spent waiting on data when code could be doing
something else is wasteful and prevents your program from reaching its
peak throughput.  If you implement a web server that sequentially
handles requests from clients, it&rsquo;s very easy for the server to end up
waiting on a client to finish its HTTP request, or waiting on it to
consume the response.  The end result is that you are able to serve
fewer requests per second than you&rsquo;d like to serve.
</p>
<p>The second limitation is related: a blocking parser over user-controlled
input is a denial-of-service vulnerability.  Indeed the so-called &ldquo;slow
loris&rdquo; attack of the early 2010s was just that: an attack on common web
servers that drip-fed HTTP requests, one character at a time.  All it
took was a handful of slow loris connections to occupy an entire web
server.
</p>
<p>In Guile we would like to preserve the ability to write straightforward
blocking networking processes of all kinds, but under the hood to allow
those processes to suspend their requests if they would block.
</p>
<p>To do this, the first piece is to allow Guile ports to declare
themselves as being nonblocking.  This is currently supported only for
file ports, which also includes sockets, terminals, or any other port
that is backed by a file descriptor.  To do that, we use an arcane UNIX
incantation:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(let ((flags (fcntl socket F_GETFL)))
  (fcntl socket F_SETFL (logior O_NONBLOCK flags)))
</pre></div>

<p>Now the file descriptor is open in non-blocking mode.  If Guile tries to
read or write from this file and the read or write returns a result
indicating that more data can only be had by doing a blocking read or
write, Guile will block by polling on the socket&rsquo;s <code class="code">read-wait-fd</code>
or <code class="code">write-wait-fd</code>, to preserve the illusion of a blocking read or
write.  See <a class="xref" href="I_002fO-Extensions.html">Implementing New Port Types in C</a> for more on those internal interfaces.
</p>
<p>So far we have just reproduced the status quo: the file descriptor is
non-blocking, but the operations on the port do block.  To go farther,
it would be nice if we could suspend the &ldquo;thread&rdquo; using delimited
continuations, and only resume the thread once the file descriptor is
readable or writable.  (See <a class="xref" href="Prompts.html">Prompts</a>).
</p>
<p>But here we run into a difficulty.  The ports code is implemented in C,
which means that although we can suspend the computation to some outer
prompt, we can&rsquo;t resume it because Guile can&rsquo;t resume delimited
continuations that capture the C stack.
</p>
<p>To overcome this difficulty we have created a compatible but entirely
parallel implementation of port operations.  To use this implementation,
do the following:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(use-modules (ice-9 suspendable-ports))
(install-suspendable-ports!)
</pre></div>

<p>This will replace the core I/O primitives like <code class="code">get-char</code> and
<code class="code">put-bytevector</code> with new versions that are exactly the same as the
ones in the standard library, but with two differences.  One is that
when a read or a write would block, the suspendable port operations call
out the value of the <code class="code">current-read-waiter</code> or
<code class="code">current-write-waiter</code> parameter, as appropriate.
See <a class="xref" href="Parameters.html">Parameters</a>.  The default read and write waiters do the same thing
that the C read and write waiters do, which is to poll.  User code can
parameterize the waiters, though, enabling the computation to suspend
and allow the program to process other I/O operations.  Because the new
suspendable ports implementation is written in Scheme, that suspended
computation can resume again later when it is able to make progress.
Success!
</p>
<p>The other main difference is that because the new ports implementation
is written in Scheme, it is slower than C, currently by a factor of 3 or
4, though it depends on many factors.  For this reason we have to keep
the C implementations as the default ones.  One day when Guile&rsquo;s
compiler is better, we can close this gap and have only one port
operation implementation again.
</p>
<p>Note that Guile does not currently include an implementation of the
facility to suspend the current thread and schedule other threads in the
meantime.  Before adding such a thing, we want to make sure that we&rsquo;re
providing the right primitives that can be used to build schedulers and
other user-space concurrency patterns, and that the patterns that we
settle on are the right patterns.  In the meantime, have a look at 8sync
(<a class="url" href="https://gnu.org/software/8sync">https://gnu.org/software/8sync</a>) for a prototype of an
asynchronous I/O and concurrency facility.

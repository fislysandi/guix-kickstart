<h3 class="section" id="Combining-with-C-Code">1.2 Combining with C Code</h3>

<p>Like a shell, Guile can run interactively&mdash;reading expressions from the user,
evaluating them, and displaying the results&mdash;or as a script interpreter,
reading and executing Scheme code from a file.  Guile also provides an object
library, <em class="dfn">libguile</em>, that allows other applications to easily incorporate a
complete Scheme interpreter.  An application can then use Guile as an extension
language, a clean and powerful configuration language, or as multi-purpose
&ldquo;glue&rdquo;, connecting primitives provided by the application.  It is easy to call
Scheme code from C code and vice versa, giving the application designer full
control of how and when to invoke the interpreter.  Applications can add new
functions, data types, control structures, and even syntax to Guile, creating a
domain-specific language tailored to the task at hand, but based on a robust
language design.
</p>
<p>This kind of combination is helped by four aspects of Guile&rsquo;s design
and history.  First is that Guile has always been targeted as an
extension language.  Hence its C API has always been of great
importance, and has been developed accordingly.  Second and third are
rather technical points&mdash;that Guile uses conservative garbage
collection, and that it implements the Scheme concept of continuations
by copying and reinstating the C stack&mdash;but whose practical
consequence is that most existing C code can be glued into Guile as
is, without needing modifications to cope with strange Scheme
execution flows.  Last is the module system, which helps extensions to
coexist without stepping on each others&rsquo; toes.
</p>
<p>Guile&rsquo;s module system allows one to break up a large program into
manageable sections with well-defined interfaces between them.
Modules may contain a mixture of interpreted and compiled code; Guile
can use either static or dynamic linking to incorporate compiled code.
Modules also encourage developers to package up useful collections of
routines for general distribution; as of this writing, one can find
Emacs interfaces, database access routines, compilers, <abbr class="acronym">GUI</abbr>
toolkit interfaces, and <abbr class="acronym">HTTP</abbr> client functions, among others.

<p>Guile has achieved much of what it set out to achieve, but there is
much remaining to do.
</p>
<p>There is still the old problem of bringing existing applications into
a more Emacs-like experience. Guile has had some successes in this
respect, but still most applications in the GNU system are without
Guile integration.
</p>
<p>Getting Guile to those applications takes an investment, the
&ldquo;hacktivation energy&rdquo; needed to wire Guile into a program that only
pays off once it is good enough to enable new kinds of behavior. This
would be a great way for new hackers to contribute: take an
application that you use and that you know well, think of something
that it can&rsquo;t yet do, and figure out a way to integrate Guile and
implement that task in Guile.
</p>
<p>With time, perhaps this exposure can reverse itself, whereby programs
can run under Guile instead of vice versa, eventually resulting in the
Emacsification of the entire GNU system. Indeed, this is the reason
for the naming of the many Guile modules that live in the <code class="code">ice-9</code>
namespace, a nod to the fictional substance in Kurt Vonnegut&rsquo;s
novel, Cat&rsquo;s Cradle, capable of acting as a seed crystal to
crystallize the mass of software.
</p>
<p>Implicit to this whole discussion is the idea that dynamic languages
are somehow better than languages like C. While languages like C have
their place, Guile&rsquo;s take on this question is that yes, Scheme is more
expressive than C, and more fun to write. This realization carries an
imperative with it to write as much code in Scheme as possible rather
than in other languages.
</p>
<p>These days it is possible to write extensible applications almost
entirely from high-level languages, through byte-code and native
compilation, speed gains in the underlying hardware, and foreign call
interfaces in the high-level language.  Smalltalk systems are like this,
as are Common Lisp-based systems.  While there already are a number of
pure-Guile applications out there, in the past users have still needed
to drop down to C for some tasks: interfacing to system libraries that
don&rsquo;t have prebuilt Guile interfaces, and for some tasks requiring high
performance.  With the arrival of native code generation via a JIT
compiler in Guile 3.0, most of these older applications can now be
updated to move more C code to Scheme.
</p>
<p>Still, even with an all-Guile application, sometimes you want to
provide an opportunity for users to extend your program from a
language with a syntax that is closer to C, or to Python. Another
interesting idea to consider is compiling e.g. Python to Guile. It&rsquo;s
not that far-fetched of an idea: see for example IronPython or JRuby.
</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s Emacs itself.  Guile&rsquo;s Emacs Lisp support has reached an
excellent level of correctness, robustness, and speed.  However there is
still work to do to finish its integration into Emacs itself.  This will
give lots of exciting things to Emacs: native threads, a real object
system, more sophisticated types, cleaner syntax, and access to all of
the Guile extensions.
</p>
<p>Finally, so much of the world&rsquo;s computation is performed in web browsers
that it makes sense to ask ourselves what the Guile-on-the-web-client
story is.  With the advent of WebAssembly, there may finally be a
reasonable compilation target that&rsquo;s present on almost all user-exposed
devices.  Especially with the upcoming proposals to allow for tail
calls, delimited continuations, and GC-managed objects, Scheme might
once again have a place in the web browser.  Get to it!

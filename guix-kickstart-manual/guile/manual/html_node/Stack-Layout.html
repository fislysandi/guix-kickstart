<h4 class="subsection" id="Stack-Layout-1">9.3.3 Stack Layout</h4>

<p>The stack of Guile&rsquo;s virtual machine is composed of <em class="dfn">frames</em>. Each
frame corresponds to the application of one compiled procedure, and
contains storage space for arguments, local variables, and some
bookkeeping information (such as what to do after the frame is
finished).
</p>
<p>While the compiler is free to do whatever it wants to, as long as the
semantics of a computation are preserved, in practice every time you
call a function, a new frame is created. (The notable exception of
course is the tail call case, see <a class="pxref" href="Tail-Calls.html">Tail calls</a>.)
</p>
<p>The structure of the top stack frame is as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">   | ...previous frame locals...  |
   +==============================+ &lt;- fp + 3
   | Dynamic link                 |
   +------------------------------+
   | Virtual return address (vRA) |
   +------------------------------+
   | Machine return address (mRA) |
   +==============================+ &lt;- fp
   | Local 0                      |
   +------------------------------+
   | Local 1                      |
   +------------------------------+
   | ...                          |
   +------------------------------+
   | Local N-1                    |
   \------------------------------/ &lt;- sp
</pre></div>

<p>In the above drawing, the stack grows downward.  At the beginning of a
function call, the procedure being applied is in local 0, followed by
the arguments from local 1.  After the procedure checks that it is being
passed a compatible set of arguments, the procedure allocates some
additional space in the frame to hold variables local to the function.
</p>
<p>Note that once a value in a local variable slot is no longer needed,
Guile is free to re-use that slot.  This applies to the slots that were
initially used for the callee and arguments, too.  For this reason,
backtraces in Guile aren&rsquo;t always able to show all of the arguments: it
could be that the slot corresponding to that argument was re-used by
some other variable.
</p>
<p>The <em class="dfn">virtual return address</em> is the <code class="code">ip</code> that was in effect
before this program was applied.  When we return from this activation
frame, we will jump back to this <code class="code">ip</code>.  Likewise, the <em class="dfn">dynamic
link</em> is the offset of the <code class="code">fp</code> that was in effect before this
program was applied, relative to the current <code class="code">fp</code>.
</p>
<p>There are two return addresses: the virtual return address (vRA), and
the machine return address (mRA).  The vRA is always present and
indicates a bytecode address.  The mRA is only present when a call is
made from a function with machine code (e.g. a function that has been
JIT-compiled).
</p>
<p>To prepare for a non-tail application, Guile&rsquo;s VM will emit code that
shuffles the function to apply and its arguments into appropriate stack
slots, with three free slots below them.  The call then initializes
those free slots to hold the machine return address (or NULL), the
virtual return address, and the offset to the previous frame pointer
(<code class="code">fp</code>).  It then gets the <code class="code">ip</code> for the function being called
and adjusts <code class="code">fp</code> to point to the new call frame.
</p>
<p>In this way, the dynamic link links the current frame to the previous
frame.  Computing a stack trace involves traversing these frames.
</p>
<p>Each stack local in Guile is 64 bits wide, even on 32-bit architectures.
This allows Guile to preserve its uniform treatment of stack locals
while allowing for unboxed arithmetic on 64-bit integers and
floating-point numbers.  See <a class="xref" href="Instruction-Set.html">Instruction Set</a>, for more on unboxed
arithmetic.
</p>
<p>As an implementation detail, we actually store the dynamic link as an
offset and not an absolute value because the stack can move at runtime
as it expands or during partial continuation calls.  If it were an
absolute value, we would have to walk the frames, relocating frame
pointers.

<h4 class="subsection" id="Example_003a-Using-Guile-for-an-Application-Testbed">5.7.3 Example: Using Guile for an Application Testbed</h4>

<p>As an example of what this means in practice, imagine writing a testbed
for an application that is tested by submitting various requests (via a
C interface) and validating the output received.  Suppose further that
the application keeps an idea of its current state, and that the
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; output for a given request may depend on the current
application state.  A complete &ldquo;white box&rdquo;<a class="footnote" id="DOCF6" href="#FOOT6"><sup>6</sup></a> test plan for this application would aim to
submit all possible requests in each distinguishable state, and validate
the output for all request/state combinations.
</p>
<p>To write all this test code in C would be very tedious.  Suppose instead
that the testbed code adds a single new C function, to submit an
arbitrary request and return the response, and then uses Guile to export
this function as a Scheme procedure.  The rest of the testbed can then
be written in Scheme, and so benefits from all the advantages of
programming in Scheme that were described in the previous section.
</p>
<p>(In this particular example, there is an additional benefit of writing
most of the testbed in Scheme.  A common problem for white box testing
is that mistakes and mistaken assumptions in the application under test
can easily be reproduced in the testbed code.  It is more difficult to
copy mistakes like this when the testbed is written in a different
language from the application.)

<h4 class="subsection" id="Types-and-the-Web-1">7.3.1 Types and the Web</h4>

<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a program with good use of
data types, will be free from many common bugs.  Unfortunately, the
common practice in web programming seems to ignore this maxim.  This
subsection makes the case for expressive data types in web programming.
</p>
<p>By &ldquo;expressive data types&rdquo;, we mean that the data types <em class="emph">say</em>
something about how a program solves a problem.  For example, if we
choose to represent dates using SRFI 19 date records (see <a class="pxref" href="SRFI_002d19.html">SRFI-19 - Time/Date Library</a>),
this indicates that there is a part of the program that will always have
valid dates.  Error handling for a number of basic cases, like invalid
dates, occurs on the boundary in which we produce a SRFI 19 date record
from other types, like strings.
</p>
<p>With regards to the web, data types are helpful in the two broad phases
of HTTP messages: parsing and generation.
</p>
<p>Consider a server, which has to parse a request, and produce a response.
Guile will parse the request into an HTTP request object
(see <a class="pxref" href="Requests.html">HTTP Requests</a>), with each header parsed into an appropriate Scheme
data type.  This transition from an incoming stream of characters to
typed data is a state change in a program&mdash;the strings might parse, or
they might not, and something has to happen if they do not.  (Guile
throws an error in this case.)  But after you have the parsed request,
&ldquo;client&rdquo; code (code built on top of the Guile web framework) will not
have to check for syntactic validity.  The types already make this
information manifest.
</p>
<p>This state change on the parsing boundary makes programs more robust,
as they themselves are freed from the need to do a number of common
error checks, and they can use normal Scheme procedures to handle a
request instead of ad-hoc string parsers.
</p>
<p>The need for types on the response generation side (in a server) is more
subtle, though not less important.  Consider the example of a POST
handler, which prints out the text that a user submits from a form.
Such a handler might include a procedure like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">;; First, a helper procedure
(define (para . contents)
  (string-append &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; (string-concatenate contents) &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;))

;; Now the meat of our simple web application
(define (you-said text)
  (para &quot;You said: &quot; text))

(display (you-said &quot;Hi!&quot;))
-| &lt;p&gt;You said: Hi!&lt;/p&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>This is a perfectly valid implementation, provided that the incoming
text does not contain the special HTML characters &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">&amp;</samp>&rsquo;.  But this provision of a restricted character set is not
reflected anywhere in the program itself: we must <em class="emph">assume</em> that the
programmer understands this, and performs the check elsewhere.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the short history of the practice of programming does not
bear out this assumption.  A <em class="dfn">cross-site scripting</em> (<abbr class="acronym">XSS</abbr>)
vulnerability is just such a common error in which unfiltered user input
is allowed into the output.  A user could submit a crafted comment to
your web site which results in visitors running malicious Javascript,
within the security context of your domain:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(display (you-said &quot;&lt;script src=\&quot;http://bad.com/nasty.js\&quot; /&gt;&quot;))
-| &lt;p&gt;You said: &lt;script src=&quot;http://bad.com/nasty.js&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The fundamental problem here is that both user data and the program
template are represented using strings.  This identity means that types
can&rsquo;t help the programmer to make a distinction between these two, so
they get confused.
</p>
<p>There are a number of possible solutions, but perhaps the best is to
treat HTML not as strings, but as native s-expressions: as SXML.  The
basic idea is that HTML is either text, represented by a string, or an
element, represented as a tagged list.  So &lsquo;<samp class="samp">foo</samp>&rsquo; becomes
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">&quot;foo&quot;</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;b&gt;foo&lt;/b&gt;</samp>&rsquo; becomes &lsquo;<samp class="samp">(b &quot;foo&quot;)</samp>&rsquo;.
Attributes, if present, go in a tagged list headed by &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@</samp>&rsquo;, like
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">(img (@ (src &quot;http://example.com/foo.png&quot;)))</samp>&rsquo;.  See <a class="xref" href="SXML.html">SXML</a>, for
more information.
</p>
<p>The good thing about SXML is that HTML elements cannot be confused with
text.  Let&rsquo;s make a new definition of <code class="code">para</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(define (para . contents)
  `(p ,@contents))

(use-modules (sxml simple))
(sxml-&gt;xml (you-said &quot;Hi!&quot;))
-| &lt;p&gt;You said: Hi!&lt;/p&gt;

(sxml-&gt;xml (you-said &quot;&lt;i&gt;Rats, foiled again!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;))
-| &lt;p&gt;You said: &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Rats, foiled again!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>So we see in the second example that HTML elements cannot be unwittingly
introduced into the output.  However it is now perfectly acceptable to
pass SXML to <code class="code">you-said</code>; in fact, that is the big advantage of SXML
over everything-as-a-string.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(sxml-&gt;xml (you-said (you-said &quot;&lt;Hi!&gt;&quot;)))
-| &lt;p&gt;You said: &lt;p&gt;You said: &amp;lt;Hi!&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The SXML types allow procedures to <em class="emph">compose</em>.  The types make
manifest which parts are HTML elements, and which are text.  So you
needn&rsquo;t worry about escaping user input; the type transition back to a
string handles that for you.  <abbr class="acronym">XSS</abbr> vulnerabilities are a thing
of the past.
</p>
<p>Well.  That&rsquo;s all very nice and opinionated and such, but how do I use
the thing?  Read on!

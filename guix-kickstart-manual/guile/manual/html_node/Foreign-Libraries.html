<h4 class="subsection" id="Foreign-Libraries-1">6.19.1 Foreign Libraries</h4>

<p>Just as Guile can load up Scheme libraries at run-time, Guile can also
load some system libraries written in C or other low-level languages.
We refer to these as dynamically-loadable modules as <em class="dfn">foreign
libraries</em>, to distinguish them from native libraries written in Scheme
or other languages implemented by Guile.
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-foreign-libraries"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-libraries_002c-foreign"></a>
</p>
<p>Foreign libraries usually come in two forms.  Some foreign libraries are
part of the operating system, such as the compression library
<code class="code">libz</code>.  These shared libraries are built in such a way that many
programs can use their functionality without duplicating their code.
When a program written in C is built, it can declare that it uses a
specific set of shared libraries.
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-shared-libraries"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-libraries_002c-shared"></a>
When the program is run, the operating system takes care of locating and
loading the shared libraries.
</p>
<p>The operating system components that can dynamically load and link
shared libraries when a program is run are also available
programmatically during a program&rsquo;s execution.  This is the interface
that&rsquo;s most useful for Guile, and this is what we mean in Guile when we
refer to <em class="dfn">dynamic linking</em>.  Dynamic linking at run-time is
sometimes called <em class="dfn">dlopening</em>, to distinguish it from the dynamic
linking that happens at program start-up.
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dynamic-linking"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dlopening"></a>
</p>
<p>The other kind of foreign library is sometimes known as a module,
plug-in, bundle, or an extension.  These foreign libraries aren&rsquo;t meant
to be linked to by C programs, but rather only to be dynamically loaded
at run-time &ndash; they extend some main program with functionality, but
don&rsquo;t stand on their own.  Sometimes a Guile library will implement some
of its functionality in a loadable module.
</p>
<p>In either case, the interface on the Guile side is the same.  You load
the interface using <code class="code">load-foreign-library</code>.  The resulting foreign
library object implements a simple lookup interface whereby the user can
get addresses of data or code exported by the library.  There is no
facility to inspect foreign libraries; you have to know what&rsquo;s in there
already before you look.
</p>
<p>Routines for loading foreign libraries and accessing their contents are
implemented in the <code class="code">(system foreign-library)</code> module.

<dl class="first-deffn">
<dt class="deffn" id="index-load_002dforeign_002dlibrary"><span class="category-def">Scheme Procedure: </span><span><strong class="def-name">load-foreign-library</strong> <var class="def-var-arguments">[library]        [#:extensions=system-library-extensions]        [#:search-ltdl-library-path?=#t]        [#:search-path=search-path]        [#:search-system-paths?=#t] [#:lazy?=#t] [#:global=#f]</var><a class="copiable-link" href='#index-load_002dforeign_002dlibrary'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>[#:rename-on-cygwin?=#t]
Find the shared library denoted by <var class="var">library</var> (a string or <code class="code">#f</code>)
and link it into the running Guile application.  When everything works
out, return a Scheme object suitable for representing the linked object
file.  Otherwise an error is thrown.
</p>
<p>If <var class="var">library</var> argument is omitted, it defaults to <code class="code">#f</code>.  If
<code class="code">library</code> is false, the resulting foreign library gives access to
all symbols available for dynamic linking in the main binary.
</p>
<p>It is not necessary to include any extension such as <code class="code">.so</code> in
<var class="var">library</var>.  For each system, Guile has a default set of extensions
that it will try.  On GNU systems, the default extension set is just
<code class="code">.so</code>; on Windows, just <code class="code">.dll</code>; and on Darwin (Mac OS), it is
<code class="code">.bundle</code>, <code class="code">.so</code>, and <code class="code">.dylib</code>.  Pass <code class="code">#:extensions
<var class="var">extensions</var></code> to override the default extensions list.  If
<var class="var">library</var> contains one of the extensions, no extensions are tried,
so it is possible to specify the extension if you know exactly what file
to load.
</p>
<p>Unless <var class="var">library</var> denotes an absolute file name or otherwise contains
a directory separator (<code class="code">/</code>, and also <code class="code">\</code> on Windows), Guile
will search for the library in the directories listed in
<var class="var">search-paths</var>.  The default search path has three components, which
can all be overriden by colon-delimited (semicolon on Windows)
environment variables:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><code class="env">GUILE_EXTENSIONS_PATH</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is the main environment variable for users to add directories
containing Guile extensions.  The default value has no entries.  This
environment variable was added in Guile 3.0.6.
</p></dd>
<dt><code class="env">LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH</code></dt>
<dd><p>Before Guile 3.0.6, Guile loaded foreign libraries using <code class="code">libltdl</code>,
the dynamic library loader provided by libtool.  This loader used
<code class="env">LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, and for backwards compatibility we still
support that path.
</p>
<p>However, <code class="code">libltdl</code> would not only open <code class="code">.so</code> (or <code class="code">.dll</code>
and so on) files, but also the <code class="code">.la</code> files created by libtool.  In
installed libraries &ndash; libraries that are in the target directories of
<code class="code">make install</code> &ndash; <code class="code">.la</code> files are never needed, to the extent
that most GNU/Linux distributions remove them entirely.  It is
sufficient to just load the <code class="code">.so</code> (or <code class="code">.dll</code> and so on) files,
which are always located in the same directory as the <code class="code">.la</code> files.
</p>
<p>But for uninstalled dynamic libraries, like those in a build tree, the
situation is a bit of a mess.  If you have a project that uses libtool
to build libraries &ndash; which is the case for Guile, and for most projects
using autotools &ndash; and you build <samp class="file">foo.so</samp> in directory <samp class="file">D</samp>,
libtool will put <samp class="file">foo.la</samp> in <samp class="file">D</samp>, but <samp class="file">foo.so</samp> gets put
into <samp class="file">D/.libs</samp>.
</p>
<p>Users were mostly oblivious to this situation, as <code class="code">libltdl</code> had
special logic to be able to read the <code class="code">.la</code> file to know where to
find the <code class="code">.so</code>, even from an uninstalled build tree, preventing the
existence of <samp class="file">.libs</samp> from leaking out to the user.
</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t use libltdl now, essentially for flexibility and
error-reporting reasons.  But, to keep this old use-case working, if
<var class="var">search-ltdl-library-path?</var> is true, we add each entry of
<code class="code">LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to the default extensions load path,
additionally adding the <samp class="file">.libs</samp> subdirextories for each entry, in
case there are <samp class="file">.so</samp> files there instead of alongside the
<samp class="file">.la</samp> files.
</p></dd>
<dt><code class="env">GUILE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS_PATH</code></dt>
<dd><p>The last path in Guile&rsquo;s search path belongs to Guile itself, and
defaults to the libdir and the extensiondir, in that order.  For
example, if you install to <samp class="file">/opt/guile</samp>, these would probably be
<samp class="file">/opt/guile/lib</samp> and
<code class="code">/opt/guile/lib/guile/3.0/extensions</code>,
respectively.  See <a class="xref" href="Parallel-Installations.html">Parallel Installations</a>, for more details on
<code class="code">extensionsdir</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Finally, if no library is found in the search path, and if <var class="var">library</var>
is not absolute and does not include directory separators, and if
<var class="var">search-system-paths?</var> is true, the operating system may have its
own logic for where to locate <var class="var">library</var>.  For example, on GNU, there
will be a default set of paths (often <samp class="file">/usr/lib</samp> and <samp class="file">/lib</samp>,
though it depends on the system), and the <code class="code">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
environment variable can add additional paths.  Other operating systems
have other conventions.
</p>
<p>Falling back to the operating system for search is usually not a great
thing; it is a recipe for making programs that work on one machine but
not on others.  Still, when wrapping system libraries, it can be the
only way to get things working at all.
</p>
<p>If <var class="var">lazy?</var> is true (the default), Guile will request the operating
system to resolve symbols used by the loaded library as they are first
used.  If <var class="var">global?</var> is true, symbols defined by the loaded library
will be available when other modules need to resolve symbols; the
default is <code class="code">#f</code>, which keeps symbols local.
</p>
<p>If <var class="var">rename-on-cygwin?</var> is true (the default) &ndash; on Cygwin hosts only
&ndash; the search behavior is modified such that a filename that starts with
&ldquo;lib&rdquo; will be searched for under the name &ldquo;cyg&rdquo;, as is customary for
Cygwin.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The environment variables mentioned above are parsed when the
foreign-library module is first loaded and bound to parameters.  Null
path components, for example the three components of
<code class="env">GUILE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS_PATH=&quot;::&quot;</code>, are ignored.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-interpreter"></a>
<p>For a long time, Guile only had a Scheme interpreter, implemented in C.
Guile&rsquo;s interpreter operated directly on the S-expression representation
of Scheme source code.
</p>
<p>But while the interpreter was highly optimized and hand-tuned, it still
performed many needless computations during the course of evaluating a
Scheme expression.  For example, application of a function to arguments
needlessly consed up the arguments in a list. Evaluation of an
expression like <code class="code">(f x y)</code> always had to figure out whether <var class="var">f</var>
was a procedure, or a special form like <code class="code">if</code>, or something else.
The interpreter represented the lexical environment as a heap data
structure, so every evaluation caused allocation, which was of course
slow.  Et cetera.
</p>
<p>The solution to the slow-interpreter problem was to compile the
higher-level language, Scheme, into a lower-level language for which all
of the checks and dispatching have already been done&mdash;the code is
instead stripped to the bare minimum needed to &ldquo;do the job&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The question becomes then, what low-level language to choose? There are
many options.  We could compile to native code directly, but that poses
portability problems for Guile, as it is a highly cross-platform
project.
</p>
<p>So we want the performance gains that compilation provides, but we
also want to maintain the portability benefits of a single code path.
The obvious solution is to compile to a virtual machine that is
present on all Guile installations.
</p>
<p>The easiest (and most fun) way to depend on a virtual machine is to
implement the virtual machine within Guile itself.  Guile contains a
bytecode interpreter (written in C) and a Scheme to bytecode compiler
(written in Scheme).  This way the virtual machine provides what Scheme
needs (tail calls, multiple values, <code class="code">call/cc</code>) and can provide
optimized inline instructions for Guile as well (GC-managed allocations,
type checks, etc.).
</p>
<p>Guile also includes a just-in-time (JIT) compiler to translate bytecode
to native code.  Because Guile embeds a portable code generation library
(<a class="url" href="https://gitlab.com/wingo/lightening">https://gitlab.com/wingo/lightening</a>), we keep the benefits of
portability while also benefitting from fast native code.  To avoid too
much time spent in the JIT compiler itself, Guile is tuned to only emit
machine code for bytecode that is called often.
</p>
<p>The rest of this section describes that VM that Guile implements, and
the compiled procedures that run on it.
</p>
<p>Before moving on, though, we should note that though we spoke of the
interpreter in the past tense, Guile still has an interpreter. The
difference is that before, it was Guile&rsquo;s main Scheme implementation,
and so was implemented in highly optimized C; now, it is actually
implemented in Scheme, and compiled down to VM bytecode, just like any
other program.  (There is still a C interpreter around, used to
bootstrap the compiler, but it is not normally used at runtime.)
</p>
<p>The upside of implementing the interpreter in Scheme is that we preserve
tail calls and multiple-value handling between interpreted and compiled
code, and with advent of the JIT compiler in Guile 3.0 we reach the
speed of the old hand-tuned C implementation; it&rsquo;s the best of both
worlds.
</p>
<p>Also note that this decision to implement a bytecode compiler does not
preclude ahead-of-time native compilation.  More possibilities are
discussed in <a class="ref" href="Extending-the-Compiler.html">Extending the Compiler</a>.

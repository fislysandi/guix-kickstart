<p>The story of Guile is the story of bringing the development experience
of Emacs to the mass of programs on a GNU system.
</p>
<p>Emacs, when it was first created in its GNU form in 1984, was a new
take on the problem of &ldquo;how to make a program&rdquo;. The Emacs thesis is
that it is delightful to create composite programs based on an
orthogonal kernel written in a low-level language together with a
powerful, high-level extension language.
</p>
<p>Extension languages foster extensible programs, programs which adapt
readily to different users and to changing times. Proof of this can be
seen in Emacs&rsquo; current and continued existence, spanning more than a
quarter-century.
</p>
<p>Besides providing for modification of a program by others, extension
languages are good for <em class="emph">intension</em> as well. Programs built in
&ldquo;the Emacs way&rdquo; are pleasurable and easy for their authors to flesh
out with the features that they need.
</p>
<p>After the Emacs experience was appreciated more widely, a number of
hackers started to consider how to spread this experience to the rest
of the GNU system. It was clear that the easiest way to Emacsify a
program would be to embed a shared language implementation into it.

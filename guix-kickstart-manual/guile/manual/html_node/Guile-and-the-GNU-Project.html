<h3 class="section" id="Guile-and-the-GNU-Project-1">1.3 Guile and the GNU Project</h3>

<p>Guile was conceived by the GNU Project following the fantastic success
of Emacs Lisp as an extension language within Emacs.  Just as Emacs
Lisp allowed complete and unanticipated applications to be written
within the Emacs environment, the idea was that Guile should do the
same for other GNU Project applications.  This remains true today.
</p>
<p>The idea of extensibility is closely related to the GNU project&rsquo;s
primary goal, that of promoting software freedom.  Software freedom
means that people receiving a software package can modify or enhance
it to their own desires, including in ways that may not have occurred
at all to the software&rsquo;s original developers.  For programs written in
a compiled language like C, this freedom covers modifying and
rebuilding the C code; but if the program also provides an extension
language, that is usually a much friendlier and lower-barrier-of-entry
way for the user to start making their own changes.
</p>
<p>Guile is now used by GNU project applications such as AutoGen, Lilypond, Denemo,
Mailutils, TeXmacs and Gnucash, and we hope that there will be many more in
future.

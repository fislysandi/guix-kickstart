<h4 class="subsection" id="Procedures-as-Values-1">3.2.1 Procedures as Values</h4>

<p>One of the great simplifications of Scheme is that a procedure is just
another type of value, and that procedure values can be passed around
and stored in variables in exactly the same way as, for example, strings
and lists.  When we talk about a built-in standard Scheme procedure such
as <code class="code">open-input-file</code>, what we actually mean is that there is a
pre-defined top level variable called <code class="code">open-input-file</code>, whose
value is a procedure that implements what R5RS says that
<code class="code">open-input-file</code> should do.
</p>
<p>Note that this is quite different from many dialects of Lisp &mdash;
including Emacs Lisp &mdash; in which a program can use the same name with
two quite separate meanings: one meaning identifies a Lisp function,
while the other meaning identifies a Lisp variable, whose value need
have nothing to do with the function that is associated with the first
meaning.  In these dialects, functions and variables are said to live in
different <em class="dfn">namespaces</em>.
</p>
<p>In Scheme, on the other hand, all names belong to a single unified
namespace, and the variables that these names identify can hold any kind
of Scheme value, including procedure values.
</p>
<p>One consequence of the &ldquo;procedures as values&rdquo; idea is that, if you
don&rsquo;t happen to like the standard name for a Scheme procedure, you can
change it.
</p>
<p>For example, <code class="code">call-with-current-continuation</code> is a very important
standard Scheme procedure, but it also has a very long name!  So, many
programmers use the following definition to assign the same procedure
value to the more convenient name <code class="code">call/cc</code>.
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">(define call/cc call-with-current-continuation)
</pre></div>

<p>Let&rsquo;s understand exactly how this works.  The definition creates a new
variable <code class="code">call/cc</code>, and then sets its value to the value of the
variable <code class="code">call-with-current-continuation</code>; the latter value is a
procedure that implements the behaviour that R5RS specifies under the
name &ldquo;call-with-current-continuation&rdquo;.  So <code class="code">call/cc</code> ends up
holding this value as well.
</p>
<p>Now that <code class="code">call/cc</code> holds the required procedure value, you could
choose to use <code class="code">call-with-current-continuation</code> for a completely
different purpose, or just change its value so that you will get an
error if you accidentally use <code class="code">call-with-current-continuation</code> as a
procedure in your program rather than <code class="code">call/cc</code>.  For example:
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">(set! call-with-current-continuation &quot;Not a procedure any more!&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>Or you could just leave <code class="code">call-with-current-continuation</code> as it was.
It&rsquo;s perfectly fine for more than one variable to hold the same
procedure value.
</p>

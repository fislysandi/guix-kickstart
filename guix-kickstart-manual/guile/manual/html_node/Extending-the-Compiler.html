<h4 class="subsection" id="Extending-the-Compiler-1">9.4.7 Extending the Compiler</h4>

<p>At this point we take a detour from the impersonal tone of the rest of
the manual.  Admit it: if you&rsquo;ve read this far into the compiler
internals manual, you are a junkie.  Perhaps a course at your university
left you unsated, or perhaps you&rsquo;ve always harbored a desire to hack the
holy of computer science holies: a compiler.  Well you&rsquo;re in good
company, and in a good position.  Guile&rsquo;s compiler needs your help.
</p>
<p>There are many possible avenues for improving Guile&rsquo;s compiler.
Probably the most important improvement, speed-wise, will be some form
of optimized ahead-of-time native compilation with global register
allocation.  A first pass could simply extend the compiler to also emit
machine code in addition to bytecode, pre-filling the corresponding JIT
data structures referenced by the <code class="code">instrument-entry</code> bytecodes.
See <a class="xref" href="Instrumentation-Instructions.html">Instrumentation Instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>The compiler also needs help at the top end, adding new high-level
compilers.  We have JavaScript and Emacs Lisp mostly complete, but they
could use some love; Lua would be nice as well, but whatever language it
is that strikes your fancy would be welcome too.
</p>
<p>Compilers are for hacking, not for admiring or for complaining about.
Get to it!

<h4 class="subsubsection" id="R6RS-Records-1">7.6.2.8 R6RS Records</h4>

<p>The manual sections below describe Guile&rsquo;s implementation of R6RS
records, which provide support for user-defined data types.  The R6RS
records API provides a superset of the features provided by Guile&rsquo;s
&ldquo;native&rdquo; records, as well as those of the SRFI-9 records API;
See <a class="xref" href="Records.html">Records</a>, and <a class="ref" href="SRFI_002d9-Records.html">SRFI-9 Records</a>, for a description of those
interfaces.
</p>
<p>As with SRFI-9 and Guile&rsquo;s native records, R6RS records are constructed
using a record-type descriptor that specifies attributes like the
record&rsquo;s name, its fields, and the mutability of those fields.
</p>
<p>R6RS records extend this framework to support single inheritance via the
specification of a &ldquo;parent&rdquo; type for a record type at definition time.
Accessors and mutator procedures for the fields of a parent type may be 
applied to records of a subtype of this parent.  A record type may be 
<em class="dfn">sealed</em>, in which case it cannot be used as the parent of another 
record type.
</p>
<p>The inheritance mechanism for record types also informs the process of
initializing the fields of a record and its parents.  Constructor
procedures that generate new instances of a record type are obtained
from a record constructor descriptor, which encapsulates the record-type
descriptor of the record to be constructed along with a <em class="dfn">protocol</em>
procedure that defines how constructors for record subtypes delegate to
the constructors of their parent types.
</p>
<p>A protocol is a procedure used by the record system at construction time
to bind arguments to the fields of the record being constructed.  The 
protocol procedure is passed a procedure <var class="var">n</var> that accepts the 
arguments required to construct the record&rsquo;s parent type; this 
procedure, when invoked, will return a procedure <var class="var">p</var> that accepts 
the arguments required to construct a new instance of the record type 
itself and returns a new instance of the record type.
</p>
<p>The protocol should in turn return a procedure that uses <var class="var">n</var> and
<var class="var">p</var> to initialize the fields of the record type and its parent
type(s).  This procedure will be the constructor returned by 
</p>
<p>As a trivial example, consider the hypothetical record type 
<code class="code">pixel</code>, which encapsulates an x-y location on a screen, and
<code class="code">voxel</code>, which has <code class="code">pixel</code> as its parent type and stores an
additional coordinate.  The following protocol produces a constructor
procedure that accepts all three coordinates, uses the first two to 
initialize the fields of <code class="code">pixel</code>, and binds the third to the single
field of <code class="code">voxel</code>.
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">  (lambda (n)
    (lambda (x y z)
      (let ((p (n x y)))
        (p z))))
</pre></div>

<p>It may be helpful to think of protocols as &ldquo;constructor factories&rdquo;
that produce chains of delegating constructors glued together by the
helper procedure <var class="var">n</var>.
</p>
<p>An R6RS record type may be declared to be <em class="dfn">nongenerative</em> via the
use of a unique generated or user-supplied symbol&mdash;or 
<em class="dfn">uid</em>&mdash;such that subsequent record type declarations with the same
uid and attributes will return the previously-declared record-type 
descriptor.
</p>
<p>R6RS record types may also be declared to be <em class="dfn">opaque</em>, in which case
the various predicates and introspection procedures defined in
<code class="code">(rnrs records introspection)</code> will behave as if records of this
type are not records at all.
</p>
<p>Note that while the R6RS records API shares much of its namespace with
both the SRFI-9 and native Guile records APIs, it is not currently
compatible with either.

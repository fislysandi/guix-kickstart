<h4 class="subsubsection" id="An-Example-of-Non_002dLexical-Scoping">3.4.4.1 An Example of Non-Lexical Scoping</h4>

<p>To demonstrate that non-lexical scoping does exist and can be useful, we
present the following example from Emacs Lisp, which is a &ldquo;dynamically
scoped&rdquo; language.
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">(defvar currency-abbreviation &quot;USD&quot;)

(defun currency-string (units hundredths)
  (concat currency-abbreviation
          (number-to-string units)
          &quot;.&quot;
          (number-to-string hundredths)))

(defun french-currency-string (units hundredths)
  (let ((currency-abbreviation &quot;FRF&quot;))
    (currency-string units hundredths)))
</pre></div>

<p>The question to focus on here is: what does the identifier
<code class="code">currency-abbreviation</code> refer to in the <code class="code">currency-string</code>
function?  The answer, in Emacs Lisp, is that all variable bindings go
onto a single stack, and that <code class="code">currency-abbreviation</code> refers to the
topmost binding from that stack which has the name
&ldquo;currency-abbreviation&rdquo;.  The binding that is created by the
<code class="code">defvar</code> form, to the value <code class="code">&quot;USD&quot;</code>, is only relevant if none
of the code that calls <code class="code">currency-string</code> rebinds the name
&ldquo;currency-abbreviation&rdquo; in the meanwhile.
</p>
<p>The second function <code class="code">french-currency-string</code> works precisely by
taking advantage of this behaviour.  It creates a new binding for the
name &ldquo;currency-abbreviation&rdquo; which overrides the one established by
the <code class="code">defvar</code> form.
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">;; Note!  This is Emacs Lisp evaluation, not Scheme!
(french-currency-string 33 44)
&rArr;
&quot;FRF33.44&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at the corresponding, <em class="emph">lexically scoped</em> Scheme
code:
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">(define currency-abbreviation &quot;USD&quot;)

(define (currency-string units hundredths)
  (string-append currency-abbreviation
                 (number-&gt;string units)
                 &quot;.&quot;
                 (number-&gt;string hundredths)))

(define (french-currency-string units hundredths)
  (let ((currency-abbreviation &quot;FRF&quot;))
    (currency-string units hundredths)))
</pre></div>

<p>According to the rules of lexical scoping, the
<code class="code">currency-abbreviation</code> in <code class="code">currency-string</code> refers to the
variable location in the innermost environment at that point in the code
which has a binding for <code class="code">currency-abbreviation</code>, which is the
variable location in the top level environment created by the preceding
<code class="code">(define currency-abbreviation &hellip;)</code> expression.
</p>
<p>In Scheme, therefore, the <code class="code">french-currency-string</code> procedure does
not work as intended.  The variable binding that it creates for
&ldquo;currency-abbreviation&rdquo; is purely local to the code that forms the
body of the <code class="code">let</code> expression.  Since this code doesn&rsquo;t directly use
the name &ldquo;currency-abbreviation&rdquo; at all, the binding is pointless.
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">(french-currency-string 33 44)
&rArr;
&quot;USD33.44&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>This begs the question of how the Emacs Lisp behaviour can be
implemented in Scheme.  In general, this is a design question whose
answer depends upon the problem that is being addressed.  In this case,
the best answer may be that <code class="code">currency-string</code> should be
redesigned so that it can take an optional third argument.  This third
argument, if supplied, is interpreted as a currency abbreviation that
overrides the default.
</p>
<p>It is possible to change <code class="code">french-currency-string</code> so that it mostly
works without changing <code class="code">currency-string</code>, but the fix is inelegant,
and susceptible to interrupts that could leave the
<code class="code">currency-abbreviation</code> variable in the wrong state:
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">(define (french-currency-string units hundredths)
  (set! currency-abbreviation &quot;FRF&quot;)
  (let ((result (currency-string units hundredths)))
    (set! currency-abbreviation &quot;USD&quot;)
    result))
</pre></div>

<p>The key point here is that the code does not create any local binding
for the identifier <code class="code">currency-abbreviation</code>, so all occurrences of
this identifier refer to the top level variable.

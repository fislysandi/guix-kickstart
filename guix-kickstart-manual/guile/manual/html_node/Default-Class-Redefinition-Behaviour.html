<h4 class="subsection" id="Default-Class-Redefinition-Behaviour-1">8.12.2 Default Class Redefinition Behaviour</h4>

<p>When a class is defined using <code class="code">define-class</code> and the class name was
previously defined, by default the new binding just replaces the old
binding.  This is the normal behavior for <code class="code">define</code>.  However if
both the old and new bindings are redefinable classes (instances of
<code class="code">&lt;redefinable-class&gt;</code>), then the class will be updated in place,
and its instances lazily migrated over.
</p>
<p>The way that the class is updated and the way that the instances migrate
over are of course part of the meta-object protocol.  However the
default behavior usually suffices, and it goes as follows.
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>All existing direct instances of <code class="code">&lt;my-class&gt;</code> are converted to be
instances of the new class.  This is achieved by preserving the values
of slots that exist in both the old and new definitions, and
initializing the values of new slots in the usual way (see <a class="pxref" href="Instance-Creation.html">make</a>).

</li><li>All existing subclasses of <code class="code">&lt;my-class&gt;</code> are redefined, as though
the <code class="code">define-class</code> expressions that defined them were re-evaluated
following the redefinition of <code class="code">&lt;my-class&gt;</code>, and the class
redefinition process described here is applied recursively to the
redefined subclasses.

</li><li>Once all of its instances and subclasses have been updated, the class
metaobject previously bound to the variable <code class="code">&lt;my-class&gt;</code> is no
longer needed and so can be allowed to be garbage collected.
</li></ul>

<p>To keep things tidy, GOOPS also needs to do a little housekeeping on
methods that are associated with the redefined class.
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Slot accessor methods for slots in the old definition should be removed
from their generic functions.  They will be replaced by accessor methods
for the slots of the new class definition.

</li><li>Any generic function method that uses the old <code class="code">&lt;my-class&gt;</code> metaobject
as one of its formal parameter specializers must be updated to refer to
the new <code class="code">&lt;my-class&gt;</code> metaobject.  (Whenever a new generic function
method is defined, <code class="code">define-method</code> adds the method to a list stored
in the class metaobject for each class used as a formal parameter
specializer, so it is easy to identify all the methods that must be
updated when a class is redefined.)
</li></ul>

<p>If this class redefinition strategy strikes you as rather counter-intuitive,
bear in mind that it is derived from similar behaviour in other object
systems such as CLOS, and that experience in those systems has shown it to be
very useful in practice.
</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that, like most of GOOPS&rsquo; default behaviour, it can
be customized&hellip;

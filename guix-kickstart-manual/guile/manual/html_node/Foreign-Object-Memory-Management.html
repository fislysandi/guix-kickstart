<h4 class="subsection" id="Foreign-Object-Memory-Management-1">5.5.4 Foreign Object Memory Management</h4>

<p>Once a foreign object has been released to the tender mercies of the
Scheme system, it must be prepared to survive garbage collection.  In
the example above, all the memory associated with the foreign object is
managed by the garbage collector because we used the <code class="code">scm_gc_</code>
allocation functions.  Thus, no special care must be taken: the garbage
collector automatically scans them and reclaims any unused memory.
</p>
<p>However, when data associated with a foreign object is managed in some
other way&mdash;e.g., <code class="code">malloc</code>&rsquo;d memory or file descriptors&mdash;it is
possible to specify a <em class="dfn">finalizer</em> function to release those
resources when the foreign object is reclaimed.
</p>
<p>As discussed in see <a class="pxref" href="Garbage-Collection.html">Garbage Collection</a>, Guile&rsquo;s garbage collector
will reclaim inaccessible memory as needed.  This reclamation process
runs concurrently with the main program.  When Guile analyzes the heap
and determines that an object&rsquo;s memory can be reclaimed, that memory is
put on a &ldquo;free list&rdquo; of objects that can be reclaimed.  Usually that&rsquo;s
the end of it&mdash;the object is available for immediate re-use.  However
some objects can have &ldquo;finalizers&rdquo; associated with them&mdash;functions
that are called on reclaimable objects to effect any external cleanup
actions.
</p>
<p>Finalizers are tricky business and it is best to avoid them.  They can
be invoked at unexpected times, or not at all&mdash;for example, they are
not invoked on process exit.  They don&rsquo;t help the garbage collector do
its job; in fact, they are a hindrance.  Furthermore, they perturb the
garbage collector&rsquo;s internal accounting.  The GC decides to scan the
heap when it thinks that it is necessary, after some amount of
allocation.  Finalizable objects almost always represent an amount of
allocation that is invisible to the garbage collector.  The effect can
be that the actual resource usage of a system with finalizable objects
is higher than what the GC thinks it should be.
</p>
<p>All those caveats aside, some foreign object types will need finalizers.
For example, if we had a foreign object type that wrapped file
descriptors&mdash;and we aren&rsquo;t suggesting this, as Guile already has ports
&mdash;then you might define the type like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">static SCM file_type;

static void
finalize_file (SCM file)
{
  int fd = scm_foreign_object_signed_ref (file, 0);
  if (fd &gt;= 0)
    {
      scm_foreign_object_signed_set_x (file, 0, -1);
      close (fd);
    }
}

static void
init_file_type (void)
{
  SCM name, slots;
  scm_t_struct_finalize finalizer;

  name = scm_from_utf8_symbol (&quot;file&quot;);
  slots = scm_list_1 (scm_from_utf8_symbol (&quot;fd&quot;));
  finalizer = finalize_file;

  image_type =
    scm_make_foreign_object_type (name, slots, finalizer);
}

static SCM
make_file (int fd)
{
  return scm_make_foreign_object_1 (file_type, (void *) fd);
}
</pre></div>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-finalizer"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-finalization"></a>

<p>Note that the finalizer may be invoked in ways and at times you might
not expect.  In a Guile built without threading support, finalizers are
invoked via &ldquo;asyncs&rdquo;, which interleaves them with running Scheme code;
see <a class="pxref" href="Asyncs.html">Asynchronous Interrupts</a>.  If the user&rsquo;s Guile is built with support for threads,
the finalizer will probably be called by a dedicated finalization
thread, unless the user invokes <code class="code">scm_run_finalizers ()</code> explicitly.
</p>
<p>In either case, finalizers run concurrently with the main program, and
so they need to be async-safe and thread-safe.  If for some reason this
is impossible, perhaps because you are embedding Guile in some
application that is not itself thread-safe, you have a few options.  One
is to use guardians instead of finalizers, and arrange to pump the
guardians for finalizable objects.  See <a class="xref" href="Guardians.html">Guardians</a>, for more
information.  The other option is to disable automatic finalization
entirely, and arrange to call <code class="code">scm_run_finalizers ()</code> at
appropriate points.  See <a class="xref" href="Foreign-Objects.html">Foreign Objects</a>, for more on these
interfaces.
</p>
<p>Finalizers are allowed to allocate memory, access GC-managed memory, and
in general can do anything any Guile user code can do.  This was not the
case in Guile 1.8, where finalizers were much more restricted.  In
particular, in Guile 2.0, finalizers can resuscitate objects.  We do not
recommend that users avail themselves of this possibility, however, as a
resuscitated object can re-expose other finalizable objects that have
been already finalized back to Scheme.  These objects will not be
finalized again, but they could cause use-after-free problems to code
that handles objects of that particular foreign object type.  To guard
against this possibility, robust finalization routines should clear
state from the foreign object, as in the above <code class="code">free_file</code> example.
</p>
<p>One final caveat.  Foreign object finalizers are associated with the
lifetime of a foreign object, not of its fields.  If you access a field
of a finalizable foreign object, and do not arrange to keep a reference
on the foreign object itself, it could be that the outer foreign object
gets finalized while you are working with its field.
</p>
<p>For example, consider a procedure to read some data from a file, from
our example above.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">SCM
read_bytes (SCM file, SCM n)
{
  int fd;
  SCM buf;
  size_t len, pos;

  scm_assert_foreign_object_type (file_type, file);

  fd = scm_foreign_object_signed_ref (file, 0);
  if (fd &lt; 0)
    scm_wrong_type_arg_msg (&quot;read-bytes&quot;, SCM_ARG1,
                            file, &quot;open file&quot;);

  len = scm_to_size_t (n);
  SCM buf = scm_c_make_bytevector (scm_to_size_t (n));

  pos = 0;
  while (pos &lt; len)
    {
      char *bytes = SCM_BYTEVECTOR_CONTENTS (buf);
      ssize_t count = read (fd, bytes + pos, len - pos);
      if (count &lt; 0)
        scm_syserror (&quot;read-bytes&quot;);
      if (count == 0)
        break;
      pos += count;
    }

  scm_remember_upto_here_1 (file);

  return scm_values (scm_list_2 (buf, scm_from_size_t (pos)));
}
</pre></div>

<p>After the prelude, only the <code class="code">fd</code> value is used and the C compiler
has no reason to keep the <code class="code">file</code> object around.  If
<code class="code">scm_c_make_bytevector</code> results in a garbage collection,
<code class="code">file</code> might not be on the stack or anywhere else and could be
finalized, leaving <code class="code">read</code> to read a closed (or, in a multi-threaded
program, possibly re-used) file descriptor.  The use of
<code class="code">scm_remember_upto_here_1</code> prevents this, by creating a reference
to <code class="code">file</code> after all data accesses.  See <a class="xref" href="Garbage-Collection-Functions.html">Function related to Garbage Collection</a>.
</p>
<p><code class="code">scm_remember_upto_here_1</code> is only needed on finalizable objects,
because garbage collection of other values is invisible to the program
&ndash; it happens when needed, and is not observable.  But if you can, save
yourself the headache and build your program in such a way that it
doesn&rsquo;t need finalization.

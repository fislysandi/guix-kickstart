<h4 class="subsection" id="Continuations-1">6.11.6 Continuations</h4>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-continuations"></a>

<p>A &ldquo;continuation&rdquo; is the code that will execute when a given function
or expression returns.  For example, consider
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(define (foo)
  (display &quot;hello\n&quot;)
  (display (bar)) (newline)
  (exit))
</pre></div>

<p>The continuation from the call to <code class="code">bar</code> comprises a
<code class="code">display</code> of the value returned, a <code class="code">newline</code> and an
<code class="code">exit</code>.  This can be expressed as a function of one argument.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(lambda (r)
  (display r) (newline)
  (exit))
</pre></div>

<p>In Scheme, continuations are represented as special procedures just
like this.  The special property is that when a continuation is called
it abandons the current program location and jumps directly to that
represented by the continuation.
</p>
<p>A continuation is like a dynamic label, capturing at run-time a point
in program execution, including all the nested calls that have lead to
it (or rather the code that will execute when those calls return).
</p>
<p>Continuations are created with the following functions.
</p>
<dl class="first-deffn">
<dt class="deffn" id="index-call_002dwith_002dcurrent_002dcontinuation"><span class="category-def">Scheme Procedure: </span><span><strong class="def-name">call-with-current-continuation</strong> <var class="def-var-arguments">proc</var><a class="copiable-link" href='#index-call_002dwith_002dcurrent_002dcontinuation'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dt class="deffnx def-cmd-deffn" id="index-call_002fcc"><span class="category-def">Scheme Procedure: </span><span><strong class="def-name">call/cc</strong> <var class="def-var-arguments">proc</var><a class="copiable-link" href='#index-call_002fcc'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-call_002dwith_002dcurrent_002dcontinuation-2"></a>
<p>Capture the current continuation and call <code class="code">(<var class="var">proc</var>
<var class="var">cont</var>)</code> with it.  The return value is the value returned by
<var class="var">proc</var>, or when <code class="code">(<var class="var">cont</var> <var class="var">value</var>)</code> is later invoked,
the return is the <var class="var">value</var> passed.
</p>
<p>Normally <var class="var">cont</var> should be called with one argument, but when the
location resumed is expecting multiple values (see <a class="pxref" href="Multiple-Values.html">Returning and Accepting Multiple Values</a>) then they should be passed as multiple arguments, for
instance <code class="code">(<var class="var">cont</var> <var class="var">x</var> <var class="var">y</var> <var class="var">z</var>)</code>.
</p>
<p><var class="var">cont</var> may only be used from the same side of a continuation
barrier as it was created (see <a class="pxref" href="Continuation-Barriers.html">Continuation Barriers</a>), and in a
multi-threaded program only from the thread in which it was created.
</p>
<p>The call to <var class="var">proc</var> is not part of the continuation captured, it runs
only when the continuation is created.  Often a program will want to
store <var class="var">cont</var> somewhere for later use; this can be done in
<var class="var">proc</var>.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">call</code> in the name <code class="code">call-with-current-continuation</code>
refers to the way a call to <var class="var">proc</var> gives the newly created
continuation.  It&rsquo;s not related to the way a call is used later to
invoke that continuation.
</p>
<p><code class="code">call/cc</code> is an alias for <code class="code">call-with-current-continuation</code>.
This is in common use since the latter is rather long.
</p></dd></dl>

<br>
<p>Here is a simple example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(define kont #f)
(format #t &quot;the return is ~a\n&quot;
        (call/cc (lambda (k)
                   (set! kont k)
                   1)))
&rArr; the return is 1

(kont 2)
&rArr; the return is 2
</pre></div>

<p><code class="code">call/cc</code> captures a continuation in which the value returned is
going to be displayed by <code class="code">format</code>.  The <code class="code">lambda</code> stores this
in <code class="code">kont</code> and gives an initial return <code class="code">1</code> which is
displayed.  The later invocation of <code class="code">kont</code> resumes the captured
point, but this time returning <code class="code">2</code>, which is displayed.
</p>
<p>When Guile is run interactively, a call to <code class="code">format</code> like this has
an implicit return back to the read-eval-print loop.  <code class="code">call/cc</code>
captures that like any other return, which is why interactively
<code class="code">kont</code> will come back to read more input.
</p>
<br>
<p>C programmers may note that <code class="code">call/cc</code> is like <code class="code">setjmp</code> in
the way it records at runtime a point in program execution.  A call to
a continuation is like a <code class="code">longjmp</code> in that it abandons the
present location and goes to the recorded one.  Like <code class="code">longjmp</code>,
the value passed to the continuation is the value returned by
<code class="code">call/cc</code> on resuming there.  However <code class="code">longjmp</code> can only go
up the program stack, but the continuation mechanism can go anywhere.
</p>
<p>When a continuation is invoked, <code class="code">call/cc</code> and subsequent code
effectively &ldquo;returns&rdquo; a second time.  It can be confusing to imagine
a function returning more times than it was called.  It may help
instead to think of it being stealthily re-entered and then program
flow going on as normal.
</p>
<p><code class="code">dynamic-wind</code> (see <a class="pxref" href="Dynamic-Wind.html">Dynamic Wind</a>) can be used to ensure setup
and cleanup code is run when a program locus is resumed or abandoned
through the continuation mechanism.
</p>
<br>
<p>Continuations are a powerful mechanism, and can be used to implement
almost any sort of control structure, such as loops, coroutines, or
exception handlers.
</p>
<p>However the implementation of continuations in Guile is not as
efficient as one might hope, because Guile is designed to cooperate
with programs written in other languages, such as C, which do not know
about continuations.  Basically continuations are captured by a block
copy of the stack, and resumed by copying back.
</p>
<p>For this reason, continuations captured by <code class="code">call/cc</code> should be used only
when there is no other simple way to achieve the desired result, or when the
elegance of the continuation mechanism outweighs the need for performance.
</p>
<p>Escapes upwards from loops or nested functions are generally best
handled with prompts (see <a class="pxref" href="Prompts.html">Prompts</a>).  Coroutines can be
efficiently implemented with cooperating threads (a thread holds a
full program stack but doesn&rsquo;t copy it around the way continuations
do).

<span id="Commit-Access-1"></span><h3 class="section">22.8 Commit Access</h3>

<span id="index-commit-access_002c-for-developers"></span>
<p>Everyone can contribute to Guix without having commit access
(see <a href="Submitting-Patches.html">Submitting Patches</a>).  However, for frequent contributors,
having write access to the repository can be convenient.  As a rule of
thumb, a contributor should have accumulated fifty (50) reviewed commits
to be considered as a committer and have sustained their activity in the
project for at least 6 months.  This ensures enough interactions with
the contributor, which is essential for mentoring and assessing whether
they are ready to become a committer.  Commit access should not be
thought of as a &ldquo;badge of honor&rdquo; but rather as a responsibility a
contributor is willing to take to help the project.
</p>
<p>The following sections explain how to get commit access, how to be ready
to push commits, and the policies and community expectations for commits
pushed upstream.
</p>
<span id="Applying-for-Commit-Access"></span><h4 class="subsection">22.8.1 Applying for Commit Access</h4>

<p>When you deem it necessary, consider applying for commit
access by following these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Find three committers who would vouch for you.  You can view the list of
committers at
<a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/project/memberlist.php?group=guix">https://savannah.gnu.org/project/memberlist.php?group=guix</a>.  Each
of them should email a statement to <a href="mailto:guix-maintainers@gnu.org">guix-maintainers@gnu.org</a> (a
private alias for the collective of maintainers), signed with their
OpenPGP key.

<p>Committers are expected to have had some interactions with you as a
contributor and to be able to judge whether you are sufficiently
familiar with the project&rsquo;s practices.  It is <em>not</em> a judgment on
the value of your work, so a refusal should rather be interpreted as
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s try again later&rdquo;.
</p>
</li><li> Send <a href="mailto:guix-maintainers@gnu.org">guix-maintainers@gnu.org</a> a message stating your intent,
listing the three committers who support your application, signed with
the OpenPGP key you will use to sign commits, and giving its fingerprint
(see below).  See <a href="https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/">https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/</a>, for an
introduction to public-key cryptography with GnuPG.

<p>Set up GnuPG such that it never uses the SHA1 hash algorithm for digital
signatures, which is known to be unsafe since 2019, for instance by
adding the following line to <samp>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</samp> (see <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/GPG-Esoteric-Options.html#GPG-Esoteric-Options">GPG
Esoteric Options</a> in <cite>The GNU Privacy Guard Manual</cite>):
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">digest-algo sha512
</pre></div>

</li><li> Maintainers ultimately decide whether to grant you commit access,
usually following your referrals&rsquo; recommendation.

</li><li> <span id="index-OpenPGP_002c-signed-commits"></span>
If and once you&rsquo;ve been given access, please send a message to
<a href="mailto:guix-devel@gnu.org">guix-devel@gnu.org</a> to say so, again signed with the OpenPGP key
you will use to sign commits (do that before pushing your first commit).
That way, everyone can notice and ensure you control that OpenPGP key.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Important:</b> Before you can push for the first time, maintainers must:
</p>
<ol>
<li> add your OpenPGP key to the <code>keyring</code> branch;
</li><li> add your OpenPGP fingerprint to the <samp>.guix-authorizations</samp> file of
the branch(es) you will commit to.
</li></ol>
</blockquote>

</li><li> Make sure to read the rest of this section and... profit!
</li></ol>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> Maintainers are happy to give commit access to people who have been
contributing for some time and have a track record&mdash;don&rsquo;t be shy and
don&rsquo;t underestimate your work!
</p>
<p>However, note that the project is working towards a more automated patch
review and merging system, which, as a consequence, may lead us to have
fewer people with commit access to the main repository.  Stay tuned!
</p></blockquote>

<p>All commits that are pushed to the central repository on Savannah must
be signed with an OpenPGP key, and the public key should be uploaded to
your user account on Savannah and to public key servers, such as
<code>keys.openpgp.org</code>.  To configure Git to automatically sign
commits, run:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">git config commit.gpgsign true

# Substitute the fingerprint of your public PGP key.
git config user.signingkey CABBA6EA1DC0FF33
</pre></div>

<p>To check that commits are signed with correct key, use:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">make authenticate
</pre></div>

<p>You can prevent yourself from accidentally pushing unsigned or signed
with the wrong key commits to Savannah by using the pre-push Git hook
located at <samp>etc/git/pre-push</samp>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">cp etc/git/pre-push .git/hooks/pre-push
</pre></div>

<p>It additionally calls <code>make check-channel-news</code> to be sure
<samp>news.scm</samp> file is correct.
</p>
<span id="Commit-Policy"></span><h4 class="subsection">22.8.2 Commit Policy</h4>

<p>If you get commit access, please make sure to follow
the policy below (discussions of the policy can take place on
<a href="mailto:guix-devel@gnu.org">guix-devel@gnu.org</a>).
</p>
<p>Non-trivial patches should always be posted to
<a href="mailto:guix-patches@gnu.org">guix-patches@gnu.org</a> (trivial patches include fixing typos,
etc.).  This mailing list fills the patch-tracking database
(see <a href="Tracking-Bugs-and-Patches.html">Tracking Bugs and Patches</a>).
</p>
<p>For patches that just add a new package, and a simple one, it&rsquo;s OK to
commit, if you&rsquo;re confident (which means you successfully built it in a
chroot setup, and have done a reasonable copyright and license
auditing).  Likewise for package upgrades, except upgrades that trigger
a lot of rebuilds (for example, upgrading GnuTLS or GLib).  We have a
mailing list for commit notifications (<a href="mailto:guix-commits@gnu.org">guix-commits@gnu.org</a>),
so people can notice.  Before pushing your changes, make sure to run
<code>git pull --rebase</code>.
</p>
<p>When pushing a commit on behalf of somebody else, please add a
<code>Signed-off-by</code> line at the end of the commit log message&mdash;e.g.,
with <code>git am --signoff</code>.  This improves tracking of who did
what.
</p>
<p>When adding channel news entries (see <a href="Channels.html">Writing Channel
News</a>), make sure they are well-formed by running the following command
right before pushing:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">make check-channel-news
</pre></div>

<p>For anything else, please post to <a href="mailto:guix-patches@gnu.org">guix-patches@gnu.org</a> and
leave time for a review, without committing anything (see <a href="Submitting-Patches.html">Submitting Patches</a>).  If you didn’t receive any reply after two weeks, and if
you&rsquo;re confident, it&rsquo;s OK to commit.
</p>
<p>That last part is subject to being adjusted, allowing individuals to commit
directly on non-controversial changes on parts they’re familiar with.
</p>
<span id="Addressing-Issues"></span><h4 class="subsection">22.8.3 Addressing Issues</h4>

<p>Peer review (see <a href="Submitting-Patches.html">Submitting Patches</a>) and tools such as
<code>guix lint</code> (see <a href="Invoking-guix-lint.html">Invoking guix lint</a>) and the test suite
(see <a href="Running-the-Test-Suite.html">Running the Test Suite</a>) should catch issues before they are
pushed.  Yet, commits that &ldquo;break&rdquo; functionality might occasionally
go through.  When that happens, there are two priorities: mitigating
the impact, and understanding what happened to reduce the chance of
similar incidents in the future.  The responsibility for both these
things primarily lies with those involved, but like everything this is
a group effort.
</p>
<p>Some issues can directly affect all users&mdash;for instance because they
make <code>guix pull</code> fail or break core functionality, because they
break major packages (at build time or run time), or because they
introduce known security vulnerabilities.
</p>
<span id="index-reverting-commits"></span>
<p>The people involved in authoring, reviewing, and pushing such
commit(s) should be at the forefront to mitigate their impact in a
timely fashion: by pushing a followup commit to fix it (if possible),
or by reverting it to leave time to come up with a proper fix, and by
communicating with other developers about the problem.
</p>
<p>If these persons are unavailable to address the issue in time, other
committers are entitled to revert the commit(s), explaining in the
commit log and on the mailing list what the problem was, with the goal
of leaving time to the original committer, reviewer(s), and author(s)
to propose a way forward.
</p>
<p>Once the problem has been dealt with, it is the responsibility of
those involved to make sure the situation is understood.  If you are
working to understand what happened, focus on gathering information
and avoid assigning any blame.  Do ask those involved to describe what
happened, do not ask them to explain the situation&mdash;this would
implicitly blame them, which is unhelpful.  Accountability comes from
a consensus about the problem, learning from it and improving
processes so that it&rsquo;s less likely to reoccur.
</p>
<span id="Commit-Revocation"></span><h4 class="subsection">22.8.4 Commit Revocation</h4>

<p>In order to reduce the possibility of mistakes, committers will have
their Savannah account removed from the Guix Savannah project and their
key removed from <samp>.guix-authorizations</samp> after 12 months of
inactivity; they can ask to regain commit access by emailing the
maintainers, without going through the vouching process.
</p>
<p>Maintainers<a id="DOCF43" href="Commit-Access.html#FOOT43"><sup>43</sup></a> may also revoke an individual&rsquo;s
commit rights, as a last resort, if cooperation with the rest of the
community has caused too much friction&mdash;even within the bounds of the
project&rsquo;s code of conduct (see <a href="Contributing.html">Contributing</a>).  They would only do so
after public or private discussion with the individual and a clear
notice.  Examples of behavior that hinders cooperation and could lead to
such a decision include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> repeated violation of the commit policy stated above;
</li><li> repeated failure to take peer criticism into account;
</li><li> breaching trust through a series of grave incidents.
</li></ul>

<p>When maintainers resort to such a decision, they notify developers on
<a href="mailto:guix-devel@gnu.org">guix-devel@gnu.org</a>; inquiries may be sent to
<a href="mailto:guix-maintainers@gnu.org">guix-maintainers@gnu.org</a>.  Depending on the situation, the
individual may still be welcome to contribute.
</p>
<span id="Helping-Out"></span><h4 class="subsection">22.8.5 Helping Out</h4>

<p>One last thing: the project keeps moving forward because committers not
only push their own awesome changes, but also offer some of their time
<em>reviewing</em> and pushing other people&rsquo;s changes.  As a committer,
you&rsquo;re welcome to use your expertise and commit rights to help other
contributors, too!
